# Space-Colonization-Mod
This solver is made using the space colonization technique by entagma modified by me for some randomization in timings.
So start with points close to each other with point groups "attractors"(a lot of them) and "nodes"(few,as these are starting points)
point wrangle "init_associates" creates an empty array per substep to hold the associates
point wrangle "associate" will run over the group "attractors"
point wrangle "expand_tree" will run over the group "nodes"
point wrangle "expand_tree" will run over the group "nodes"
